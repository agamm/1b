1 billion company framework

Company as code framework.

The only sane way one person could create a $1B+ company alone.
Instead of notion-like system, codify your operations.


A company is built from the following business functions:
- R&D - Researching and creating your technology.
- Marketing - Reaching your audience.
- Sales - Selling your product/service.
- Support - Ongoging customer support.
- HR - Hiring, Internal needs.
- Operations - "Infra" for the company.

Imagine if you could use code to define your company operations.
Add PRs on differet types of business functions, review changes, and revert to old working states.
What if you have tangible, data-driven testable business functions.

You could sell a whole business with minimal changes. And because everything is codified, you are basically docuemnting and creating processes from day 1.

I suspect this will be possible pretty soon with AI. Specifically agents.

How would this work? Honestly, I'm not sure, but here is a start:
1. You will have an agent marketplace of differnet business functions, which you couild tweak for your target audience and service.
2. ... Or create your own custom agent.
3. They will all know how to talk to each other, have limits on spending, and will have ways to ask you, the human supervisor for approval before doing something critical.


Some technology that might be helpful:
- Langchain agents.

Potentiall problems:
- How do you "deploy"/"host" your company?
- Costs?
- What if one function isn't good enough yet? (have a system to require human intervention)?
- How can it work with companies with already 1+ roles and humans actively working?
